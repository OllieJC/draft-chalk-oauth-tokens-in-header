                      OAuth Tokens in HTTP Header
               draft-chalk-oauth-tokens-in-header-latest

Abstract

   This specification extends OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] by defining a
   mechanism for resource servers or authorisation servers to convey
   inline token updates and related metadata to clients using the
   Authentication-Info HTTP header.

1.  Introduction

   OAuth deployments range from simple bearer-only configurations to
   complex ecosystems with distinct authorisation and resource servers.
   In some scenarios a resource server holds enough contextual
   information to advise the client of a refreshed or more suitable
   token for future use.  Existing OAuth flows, however, obligate the
   client to perform a separate interaction with the authorisation
   server to obtain such updates, and certain deployments may lack an
   authorisation server altogether.

   This document defines a lightweight mechanism that leverages the
   Authentication-Info header (originally specified in [RFC7615] and
   incorporated into [RFC9110]) to convey inline token updates and
   associated metadata within a normal HTTP response.  The header can be
   processed transparently by HTTP implementations, potentially even at
   a proxy or edge service, and does not alter the client's request
   semantics.  Recipients treat the conveyed values as hints - they may
   adopt the suggested token but are not required to do so - thereby
   preserving compatibility with existing OAuth behaviour while offering
   an optional optimisation for efficiency and flexibility.
