                      OAuth Tokens in HTTP Header
               draft-chalk-oauth-tokens-in-header-latest

Abstract

   This specification extends OAuth 2.0 [RFC6749] by defining a
   mechanism for resource servers or authorisation servers to convey
   inline token updates and related metadata to clients using the
   Authentication-Info HTTP header.

1.  Introduction

   OAuth deployments vary widely, from simple bearer-only systems to
   distributed architectures with separate authorisation servers and
   resource servers.

   In some of these environments, a resource server may have enough
   context to provide updated token information or indicate a more
   appropriate token for future use.

   However, existing OAuth flows require separate interactions with the
   authorisation server to obtain updated tokens or metadata.

   Some deployments may not have an authorisation server at all, yet
   still benefit from a way to signal preferred or refreshed token state
   to clients.

   This specification introduces a lightweight mechanism for conveying
   inline token updates using the Authentication-Info header originally
   defined in [RFC7615] and now in [RFC9110].

   It operates entirely within the existing HTTP response, without
   modifying the client's request or diverting it into an alternative
   token retrieval process.

   Clients interpret the conveyed values as hints rather than strict
   directives, maintaining compatibility with current OAuth behaviour.

   The result is an optional optimisation that improves efficiency and
   flexibility across diverse deployment models.
